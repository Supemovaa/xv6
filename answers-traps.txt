1.Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0~a7; a2

2.Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
是内联的，如f+7处

3.At what address is the function printf located?
0x628

4.What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x38

5.What is the output?The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
He110 World; 0x726c6400; no

6.In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
是任何可能的数，因为这是一个未定义行为，输出的是a1寄存器中的值
